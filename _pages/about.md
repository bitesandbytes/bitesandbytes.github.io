I'm a second year Ph.D student in the CS Department at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Greg Ganger](https://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/). 

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [Dr. Harsha Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) on problems in Machine Learning and Systems. Our work (along with [Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy](https://rakri.github.io/)) resulted in a practical, cost effective system for very large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (and also a publication at NeurIPS '19). In ancient times, I have apparently worked on some topics in reinforcement learning and natural language generation systems.

I'm passionate about practical computer systems and am currently looking at ways to improve efficiency of machine learning infrastructure. I'm broadly interested in systems research, with some focus on abstractions, performance and utilization in domain-specific systems like machine learning and graph porocessing systems.

Research Interests
==================
* **Computer Systems** - ML systems, infrastructure for ML
* **Machine Learning** - algorithms for large-scale machine learning
