I'm a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India. I'm passionate about computer systems and machine learning. In the past, I've dabbled in a bit of reinforcement learning and natural language generation systems. 

I'm currently working on two problems involving systems and machine learning.
* Ensemble-distillation procedures to enable training of deep relevance models on web-scale data with over 2 Billion training points with *Dr. Harsha Simhadri, Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli*
* Developing a new algorithm to efficiently serve k-Approximate Nearest Neighour Search (k-ANNS) queries on over 10B vectors on a single multi-core system utilizing next-gen flash drives with *Dr. Harsha Simhadri, Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy,* and *Dr. Amit Deshpande*

My current research revolves around 2 themes:
* **Algorithmic techniques** for scalable machine learning
* **Cost-effective solutions** for training and inference

I'd like to work on the following problems relating to experimentation and model serving for scalable machine learning
* **Resource utilization** problems in existing platforms for training and inference
* Design of **high-performance primitives** and frameworks targeted at next-gen hardware to reduce complexity of training and inference pipelines

Research Interests
==================
* **Machine Learning** - algorithms for large-scale machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning
* **Computer Systems** - parallel processing, distributed processing, large-scale machine learning, distributed machine learning systems, next-gen machine learning systems
