I'm a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India. I'm passionate about machine learning, computer systems and robotics. In the past, I've dabbled in a bit of reinforcement learning and natural language generation systems.

Checkout [BLAS-on-flash](https://github.com/Microsoft/BLAS-on-flash) - a library to describe and execute computation graphs for data residing on disk. Our work has been accepted to [NSDI '19](http://harsha-simhadri.org/pubs/nsdi19_final.pdf) and [SysML '18](https://www.sysml.cc/doc/207.pdf).

I'm currently working on two problems involving systems and machine learning. 
* Ensemble-distillation procedures to enable training of deep relevance models on web-scale data with over 2 Billion training points with *Dr. Harsha Simhadri, Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli*
* Developing a new algorithm to efficiently serve k-Approximate Nearest Neighour Search (k-ANNS) queries on over 10B vectors on a single multi-core system utilizing next-gen flash drives with *Dr. Harsha Simhadri, Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy,* and *Dr. Amit Deshpande*

Research Interests
==================
* **Machine Learning** - algorithms for large-scale machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning
* **Computer Systems** - parallel processing, distributed processing, large-scale machine learning, distributed machine learning systems, next-gen machine learning systems
* **Robotics** - multi-agent robotics, single-agent robotics, reinforcement learning for single-agent and multi-agent robotics
