I'm a first year Ph.D student in the CS Department at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Greg Ganger](https://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/). 

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [Dr. Harsha Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) on problems in Machine Learning and Systems. Our latest work (along with [Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy](https://rakri.github.io/)) resulted in a practical, cost effective system for very large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (and also a publication at NeurIPS '19). In ancient times, I have apparently worked on some topics in reinforcement learning and natural language generation systems.

I'm passionate about practical computer systems and am currently exploring different avenues for research. I'm broadly interested in systems research, with some focus on abstractions, performance and utilization in domain-specific systems like machine learning and graph porocessing systems.

Research Interests
==================
* **Computer Systems** - performance engineering, design of efficient and powerful abstractions for domain-specific computation
* **Machine Learning** - algorithms for large-scale machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning
